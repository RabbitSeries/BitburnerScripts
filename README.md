# Bitburner scripts

I have to overwrite all README due to markdownlint and my OCD.

## TODO

- More customized remote server

    Currently, a force overwrite to [NetscriptDefinitions.d.ts](NetscriptDefinitions.d.ts) is performed on each connection, but there are a few type warning in this file with `tsconfig.compilerOptions.strict=true`.
    See [RemoteServer](Changelogs.md#remoteserver)
